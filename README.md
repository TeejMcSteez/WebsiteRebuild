# Personal Website

## The Journey

I wanted to make a cool modern website using a framework which I know has a bad and good side os development.

I tried React but didn't like it and then found Svelte which ended being the frontend UI framework I chose to go with and so far has been awesome to work with.

## Backend

All of my admin components are still with good ol' Node/Express with a very unsecure way of accessing my database but i'll implement Supabase security later as I dont care as much and all that can be edited is markdown file information that can be re-uploaded

## Plans for the future

My plan with this is to learn more about Svelte and overall modern web development and have a framework like Svelte under my belt.

Also to secure the backend with OAuth2 (Google) as well as make it look a bit nicer and add more functionality like editing my progress bars.

### Other Notes

I thought I needed a VPS solution for what I wanted to do so I went with Hetzner for a VPS server but ended up only needing Vercel which ended up being a very cool app. Being able to auto-deploy my github repo and just point my Namecheap domain to it was brilliant.
